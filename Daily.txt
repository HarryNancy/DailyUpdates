=====DOCKER=========
application layer taks with OS Kernal , kernal tals with hardwere 
using docker-compose we can build and start an image and container

===Kubernets===

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines (either physical or virtual) that run Kubernetes and host applications.

Kubernetes contains the two nodes, 1.master Node and 2.worker Node(contains all the pods(contains the containers))
master node:contains the (APIServer,Schedular,Controller Manager,and etcd)
1.intro to Kubenetes(Kubernetes Architecture)
2.components of Kubernetes(Pod,Service,configmap,secret,Volume,ingress,deployment,statefull,DeamonSet)
POD==== abstraction of containers
what is POD: small unit in kubernetes, abstraction over container, usually one application per pod, each pod gets it own IP address to talk to each other
Service=== for communicate
what is Service:service is an static IP address (permanant IP address), lifecycle of pod and service are not connected,
Ingress===route traffic into cluster
what is Ingress:instead of going to service when your request, the request goes to Ingress
ConfigMap====external configuration
what is configMap:External configuration fo Your application(config map is only for non-confedential data only)
Secret===external configuration(using encodes way)
what is secret:it is like config map only but used to store secret Data(stores the data in base64 encoded format), Reference secret in deployment or POD
volume====== data persistent
what is volume:Storage on local machine or remote, outside of the k8 cluser Note:kubernetes dosent manage data persistance
Deployments===replicating or pOD blueprints for stateless apps 
what is deployment:blueprint of pods,abstraction of pods, DB cant be replicate via the Deployment
statefull===replicating or pOD blueprints for statefull apps eg:liek data bases
what is statefull: for statefull apps like(mysql,mongoDB,and elastci search), Deployment is for stateless apps, statefullset is for statefull apps or databases

** All the configuration in kubernetes goes through a master node with a process called APIServer

each configuration file(it is in YAML Format) contains three parts 1.metadata, 2.specifiction,3.status(it is automatically generated and added by kubernetes)

Wwhat is Kubernetes:Kubernetes is opensource container orchestration tool Developed By google ,Helps manage containerized applications helps to manage in different deployment environments

what probles does kubernetes solves?: and what are the tasks of orchestration tool?:
